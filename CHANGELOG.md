# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kirra Runtime SDK are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to the semantic-versioning rules defined in
[`docs/VERSIONING_POLICY.md`](docs/VERSIONING_POLICY.md) (which also defines
the versioned public surface, the MSRV policy, and the deprecation process).

> **Version-numbering note.** The first public release shipped as **v1.5.0
> under the previous "Aegis" branding** (2026-05-23). The rename to Kirra
> restarted the version line at **v1.1.2** (2026-05-27) — so v1.1.2 is
> *newer* than v1.5.0. Versions are monotonic from v1.1.2 onward; a future
> major bump will clear the ambiguity permanently. Release automation
> (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) extracts the section matching the pushed
> tag from this file — a release without a matching section **fails the
> release job** (WS-0.7; no silent "Release vX" fallback).

## [Unreleased]

Everything since v1.1.2 (May 2026 → present). The highlights, by stream —
detail lives in `docs/adr/`, `docs/safety/`, and the PR history:

### Added

- **Learning-loop capture — hybrid capture point confirmed (G15, WS-2).** The
  `LEARNING_LOOP_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 capture-location decision is **confirmed as
  hybrid (3)**: the certified checker emits a small, fixed-shape, fire-and-forget
  verdict record on a non-safety side channel, and an isolated Linux collector
  joins it offline into the corrective-supervision triple. This is the shape the
  repo already implements — the emit is live at both seams (fast-loop command
  gateway, slow-loop trajectory), captures **every** verdict arm (Allow/Clamp/Deny,
  to avoid selection bias), is **default-OFF** behind `KIRRA_CAPTURE_ENABLED`,
  wait-free (`try_send`, drop-on-full), and keeps the verdict path byte-identical.
  The `CAPTURE_PIPELINE_SPEC §6` sub-decisions (sink=JSONL files, correlation
  key=`(source, decision_seq)`, doer-stamped model version, Parquet+bulk-ref
  dataset, stratified pass-sampling) are all bound by `COLLECTOR_DESIGN.md` D1–D6,
  and the offline `kirra-collector` exists. Remaining G15 is the downstream
  train / sim-validation / human-gated-release loop (WS-6).
- **Config schema versioning + effective-config digest (G18, WS-2).** The
  industrial Modbus gateway's `KirraRuntimeConfig` (`src/config.rs`,
  `config/asset_profile.json`) now carries a `config_version` (default
  `CONFIG_SCHEMA_VERSION`; an unversioned pre-governance file still loads) that is
  validated **fail-closed** — `0` or a version NEWER than the binary understands is
  refused, so a config from an unknown future schema is never mis-interpreted
  against renamed fields. `effective_digest()` computes a stable SHA-256 fingerprint
  of the loaded config, and the gateway prints `schema vN · sha256:…` at boot — the
  "which config is this process running?" answer for audit/attestation. First slice
  of G18; broad env-sprawl absorption for the verifier service remains.
- **SDK quickstart examples + rustdoc gate (G20, WS-2).** A runnable Rust example
  (`examples/governor_quickstart.rs` — the checker bounding a doer's proposals,
  fail-closed) and a C example (`examples/c/kirra_ffi_demo.c` + `build_and_run.sh`)
  that links the `libkirra_verifier` cdylib over the now-documented `include/kirra.h`
  ABI. Crate-level rustdoc landing page + documented FFI surface; the whole public
  lib is rustdoc-clean under `-D warnings` (14 pre-existing broken intra-doc links /
  unclosed-HTML doc tags fixed). New CI job **SDK docs + examples** gates the doc
  build and builds+runs both examples so they never rot.
- **Doer-checker planning & perception stack** — the swappable DOER
  (`kirra-planner`: geometric Occy, Mick intent seam incl. multi-junction
  `RouteTo`, learned Hydra-MDP-style planners) bounded by the CHECKER
  (`kirra-trajectory` / `kirra-ros2-adapter`: containment, per-pose
  kinematics, the RSS §4 conjunction, occlusion Rule 4, multi-modal
  predictive RSS, True-Redundancy perception cross-check), with the
  lanelet2-lite lane graph (`kirra-map`) and the Taj R2 perception layer
  (`kirra-taj`, safety-weighted eval harness).
- **QNX partition lane (EPIC #270)** — L3 end-to-end two-process
  doer→checker→release harness, POSIX-SHM hypervisor carrier
  (`kirra-hv-carrier`), release-token bridge (`kirra-release-token`,
  ADR-0031), frozen `GovernorContractView` contract channel, WCET
  measurement methodology + CI boundedness gate (`wcet_gate.rs`).
- **Diverse redundancy (CERT-006)** — `GovernorComparator` pairing the
  primary `KirraGovernor` with a structurally diverse shadow; two-axis
  divergence detection; divergence drives the live fleet posture.
- **Learned-doer quantization lane (Q-series)** — ONNX export, TensorRT
  INT8-QDQ on Orin, precision-selection ladder, per-tick perf contract.
- **Operator console & live observability** — `/console` plane
  (posture-exempt observe-and-recover), operator clearance grants,
  governor-routed e-stop requests (ADR-0013).
- **WS-0 truth-alignment series** (the seven-PR GATE A closer):
  - WS-0.1 — parko live RSS wiring; the `safe: true` construction default
    is dead (unfed governors HOLD at zero).
  - WS-0.2 — posture-generation persistence restored (restart-monotonic
    generations; federation ordering claim true again).
  - WS-0.3 — incident-class audit writes are power-loss durable at write
    time (FULL-sync WAL fsync on transitions; kill-after-incident test).
  - WS-0.4 — parko per-tick inference deadline + hung-backend watchdog;
    comparator angular reconciliation capped by the SOTIF MRC `ω_max(v)`.
  - WS-0.5 — `GET /metrics` Prometheus fleet-safety series (posture gauge,
    committed transitions, gate denials by reason, HA promotions, drop
    counters); scrape survives LockedOut.
  - WS-0.6 — cargo-deny supply-chain gate (licenses/bans/sources, both
    workspaces, one policy), CycloneDX release SBOMs, keyless cosign
    signatures over release artifacts and container images;
    `parko/Cargo.lock` is now committed.
  - WS-0.7 — this changelog, the versioning/MSRV/deprecation policy, and
    the fail-instead-of-fallback release-notes rule.
- **WS-1 (#G7) — per-principal API tokens & scoped RBAC (first PR).** A new
  `api_principals` registry (`POST/GET /system/principals`,
  `POST /system/principals/{id}/revoke`, admin-scoped) mints least-privilege
  bearer tokens across four roles (`admin` / `integrator` / `auditor` /
  `operator`). The gated route groups now terminate in a scope layer
  (`src/authz.rs`, `authorize_request`): the identity/integration surface,
  the actuator command, and a NEW read-only `auditor_routes` carve-out
  (audit verify / causal-verify / export) each admit their scoped role in
  addition to the admin token. Tokens are stored ONLY as their SHA-256 (looked
  up by hash, never plaintext); the plaintext is shown once at mint.
  `KIRRA_ADMIN_TOKEN` is RETAINED as the break-glass superuser and its
  fail-closed 503-when-absent root gate is unchanged (INVARIANT #1/#6), so an
  admin-token-only deployment is byte-compatible. (TPM-bound signing-key
  rotation and in-process TLS termination are the follow-up WS-1 PRs.)
  **Unification note:** this DB-backed system SUPERSEDES the short-lived
  env-configured registry (`KIRRA_PRINCIPAL_TOKENS`, #802/#803), which is
  **removed** — one token system, one RBAC model. Migrate an env-registry
  entry by minting a principal (`POST /system/principals`); `readonly` maps
  to the `auditor` role. The #804 admin-action attribution middleware and
  the #805 `KIRRA_REQUIRE_SECURE_TRANSPORT` transport-security gate carry
  over unchanged and compose with the scope layers (transport gate
  outermost; attribution names the resolved API principal or `root`).
- **WS-1 (#G7) — governor release-signing key provisioning seam
  (ADR-0031 Clause E, Track 1.1).** `kirra_release_token::provisioning` is the
  single fail-closed decision point for **where** the governor's Ed25519 release
  key comes from. `KIRRA_GOVERNOR_SIGNING_KEY_SOURCE` selects `file:<path>` (a
  permission-checked — Unix `mode & 0o077 == 0` — zeroized 32-byte seed) or
  `dev-fixed` (the well-known harness key, admitted ONLY under
  `KIRRA_GOVERNOR_SIGNING_KEY_ALLOW_DEV`); an unset/misconfigured source
  **refuses** rather than minting an unpinnable key that would silently break the
  trust chain. `tpm:<handle>` is wired to a single deferred refusal
  (`TpmUnsealUnsupported`) — the Phase-II TPM-unseal custody path (tss2 libs +
  hardware) lands additively at that one call site. The `kirra-l3-e2e`
  measurement harness now draws its fixed key through the seam (proving a live
  caller). Docs: `docs/safety/GOVERNOR_KEY_PROVISIONING.md`.
- **WS-1 (#G7) — opt-in in-process TLS termination (Track 1.2).** The verifier
  can now terminate TLS itself (`src/bin/kirra_verifier_service/tls.rs`): set
  `KIRRA_TLS_CERT_PATH` + `KIRRA_TLS_KEY_PATH` (PEM). It is **default-OFF** — with
  neither set the serve path is byte-identical plaintext, so ADR-0006 Clause 3's
  mesh-first default is unchanged; this only ADDS TLS for mesh-less deployments and
  discharges the `AOU-TRANSPORT-TLS-001` trusted-proxy assumption when enabled.
  Fail-closed: exactly one of the two set, or an invalid/missing cert/key, aborts
  startup **before bind** (never a silent plaintext fallback). rustls is pinned to
  the **`ring`** provider (no `aws-lc-rs` in the tree; no new rustls major — 0.23
  was already resolved via reqwest), and each connection gets its own handshake
  task (no accept-loop head-of-line blocking). A live-handshake test drives a real
  client TLS handshake + HTTP round-trip through the production config-loader. mTLS
  client-cert → principal identity is the tracked follow-up.
  Docs: `docs/safety/TRANSPORT_SECURITY.md` §4.
- **WS-1 (#G7) — mTLS client-certificate → principal (Track 1.2, completing the
  transport track).** With server TLS on, `KIRRA_TLS_CLIENT_CA_PATH` REQUIRES +
  CA-verifies client certificates via rustls's audited `WebPkiClientVerifier` (no
  hand-rolled verification in the safety path; `ring` provider). The verified leaf's
  SHA-256 fingerprint is pinned to a principal in a new `cert_principals` registry
  (`POST/GET /system/cert-principals` + `.../{id}/revoke`, admin-scoped); when a
  request carries no bearer token, that fingerprint resolves the SAME
  `ResolvedPrincipal` the token path produces — one RBAC model. CA validity proves
  authenticity; the fingerprint pin authorizes the specific cert to a role (an
  unpinned CA-valid cert → fail-closed 401). The server never sees the client's
  private key; a bearer token is never silently rescued by a cert. Live mTLS tests
  cover the handshake + fingerprint injection and no-cert rejection. This closes the
  non-hardware remainder of WS-1's transport track (TPM-unseal key custody stays the
  hardware-gated follow-up). Docs: `docs/safety/TRANSPORT_SECURITY.md` §4.

### Changed

- Degraded posture is **decel-to-stop-and-HOLD** (issue #70) at all four
  enforcement points, with `ActuatorMotion` deferral under Degraded
  (ADR-0011 Option A) — not a sustained crawl.
- Attestation verifies a **per-node Ed25519 proof** over the challenge
  (issue #73); the admin-asserted HMAC proof is removed.
- Per-class kinematic contracts selected by `KIRRA_VEHICLE_CLASS`
  (fail-closed: no default class; #312).
- `MitigationCode::RateClampEnforced`'s narrative is now **unit-neutral**
  (`RATE_CLAMP_ENFORCED: Max {max_rate}`, was `… GPM/s`). The generic scalar
  verdict serves both kinematic (m/s²) and flow (GPM/s) governors, so the
  formatter cannot assert a domain unit — the contract owns it, matching every
  other variant's bare-number style. Cosmetic/narrative only (nothing parses it);
  new gateway `kirra_replay.json` records read without the unit suffix.

### Security / supply chain

- Ed25519-signed hash-chained audit ledger with causal chain, key
  rotation, and tamper-evident export; HA epoch fencing closes the
  two-writer actuator window; deny gate + SBOM + cosign (WS-0.6).

## [v1.1.2] — 2026-05-27

First release under the **Kirra** name (see the version-numbering note
above). Full notes: [`docs/releases/v1.1.2.md`](docs/releases/v1.1.2.md).

### Fixed

- **LockedOut authority model (PARK-003, critical):** LockedOut is a hard
  stop (`Deny`, 0.0 m/s) — not an MRC cap. Corrected in the governor,
  property tests, and decision log. The three-tier authority model is:
  LockedOut → 0.0 hard stop (human reset); Degraded → MRC ceiling
  (5.0 m/s); Nominal → full kinematic envelope.

### Added

- **Parko workspace** — behavioral safety governor: RSS per
  IEEE 2846-2022 (longitudinal + lateral safe distance), `RssState` wired
  into the posture engine with recovery hysteresis, software-lockstep
  `GovernorComparator`, ONNX/OpenVINO inference backends behind the
  `InferenceBackend` seam.
- aarch64 cross-compilation support and release packaging.
- 340 new tests in the root workspace; 61 (incl. 70k proptest cases) in
  parko.

## [v1.5.0] — 2026-05-23 (Aegis era)

Published under the previous **Aegis** branding; numerically higher but
*older* than v1.1.2 (see the version-numbering note). Full notes:
[`docs/releases/v1.5.0.md`](docs/releases/v1.5.0.md).

### Added

- Multi-asset safety fabric (per-asset governors, fleet lockout
  propagation, federated causal log).
- ROS 2 safety interlock package (`cmd_vel` → governor → `cmd_vel_safe`).
- Industrial protocol adapters: EtherNet/IP, CANopen, DNP3.
- Ed25519 audit-chain signing with tamper detection.
- React operations dashboard; Helm deployment.
