# ADR-0038 — Postgres for Shared Control-Plane State, Local SQLite for the Audit Ledger (the Hybrid)

**Status:** Accepted (stage 1 merged; stages 2–3 tracked on #1030)
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Owner:** Kirra Systems, LLC
**Scope:** How #1030 ("shared-file SQLite control plane is an availability SPOF; promote Postgres") is realized. Decides WHICH storage tiers move to Postgres when `KIRRA_DB_URL` selects it, which deliberately stay local, and the staged path from today's single-backend service to the selectable one. Ratified by the owner on the #1030 scoping question (2026-07-23), superseding the earlier assumption that the whole store could switch backends behind one flag.

---

## Context

The A2 review finding (#1030) names the shared-file SQLite store as the control
plane's availability SPOF in the HA topology: primary and standby share one
database file, so the file (and its host) is a single point of failure even
though the verifier process itself fails over.

EP-10/G-9 built the exit ramp: ten storage-seam traits (`EpochFence`,
`NodeStore`, `PostureEngineStateStore`, `FederationStore`, `OperatorStore`,
`PrincipalStore`, `CertPrincipalStore`, `FabricAssetStore`, `OtaCampaignStore`,
`AvSubsystemStore`) with shared conformance suites, and
`crates/kirra-verifier-pg` binding all ten to a live Postgres server in the
`postgres-conformance` CI lane.

A full call-surface audit for this ADR established what the conformance story
does NOT cover — the service methods with **no Postgres implementation, by
explicit design** (`kirra-verifier-pg/src/lib.rs` records the audit-chaining
exclusion):

- the **hash-chained audit tier** — every `save_*_chained*` write (posture
  events, denials, federation reports, clearance grants), chain
  verification/pagination, the signing-key ledger, verdict-id lookup, the
  WORM ship cursor. These ride nearly every request;
- the **posture-event history** (`load_node_history`, flap counting, backup
  export);
- the **fabric causal log** (its own hash chain);
- the **attestation identity registry**;
- assorted epoch-fenced write variants, the HA lease rows, and
  SQLite-lifecycle methods (`is_wal_mode` — the SG-008 startup invariant —
  and `durable_checkpoint`).

Reimplementing the chained-audit tier on Postgres is a from-scratch,
safety-critical build (tamper-evidence semantics, fsync equivalence, key
ledger) — not a wiring exercise.

## Decision

**Hybrid.** When `KIRRA_DB_URL=postgres://…` is configured (stage 2), the
verifier routes the **shared control-plane state** — the ten trait-seam tiers:
node registry + trust, epoch fence, engine state/generation, federation
registry + anti-replay, operators, API/cert principals, fabric assets, OTA
campaigns + adoption, AV subsystem meta — to Postgres. The
**tamper-evident audit ledger** (audit chain, posture-event history, causal
log, key ledger) **stays on per-instance local SQLite**, always.

Rationale:

1. **The SPOF is the SHARED state.** What makes the shared file a single
   point of failure is exactly the state both instances must agree on — the
   epoch fence above all. Moving that tier to a Postgres deployment (which
   brings its own replication/HA story) removes the shared-file coupling.
2. **The audit ledger is inherently per-writer.** Each chain entry links to
   the previous entry written by THAT instance; the chain is an
   append-only, per-writer artifact whose durability story is local fsync
   (`synchronous=FULL`, the #1046 power-loss drill) and whose off-box story
   already exists — the WS-4 WORM audit shipper re-verifies the stream
   independently of the source DB. Centralizing it in Postgres would weaken
   the tamper-evidence argument (a compromised central DB rewrites every
   instance's history at once) while buying no availability (a verifier that
   cannot write its local ledger must fail closed anyway).
3. **The WCET/latency story survives.** The chained audit write rides the
   deny/verdict path; keeping it a local fsync avoids adding a network RTT
   to the safety-critical path. Shared-state writes (registration, campaign
   lifecycle) are control-plane-slow already.
4. **SG-008 stays intact.** The WAL-mode startup invariant and
   `durable_checkpoint` remain meaningful because local SQLite remains —
   they now guard the audit ledger specifically.

Consequences accepted with the hybrid: a fleet's shared state can be current
in Postgres while an instance's local ledger lags (crash between the two
writes). This is the SAME class of gap the WORM shipper's at-least-once
cursor already handles, and the write ORDER (local chained write first, then
shared-state effect — matching INVARIANT #12's disk-before-memory discipline)
keeps the ledger the pessimistic record.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Full Postgres including the audit chain.** Largest scope; weakens the
  per-writer tamper-evidence story; adds a network RTT to the deny path;
  duplicates durability machinery the local ledger + WORM shipper already
  prove. Revisitable later as an *additional* central mirror (never the
  authoritative chain).
- **Single-flag whole-store swap (the original #1030 framing).** Impossible
  as scoped: the audit tier has no PG implementation and should not get one
  (above), and `StoreHandle` passes concrete `&mut VerifierStore` closures at
  ~150 call sites — a whole-store trait object is a big-bang refactor with
  no safety payoff.

## Staging

- **Stage 1 (this ADR's PR): de-cycle.** `kirra-verifier-pg` depended on the
  ROOT crate for two type imports whose canonical home is `kirra-core`
  (`NodeTrustState`, `RegisteredNode`) — an inverted edge that made root →
  pg consumption impossible (dependency cycle). Fixed: the crate now depends
  on the leaf. No behavior change; the `postgres-conformance` lane is the
  regression evidence.
- **Stage 2 (in progress): the backend seam + flag.** First movements, merged:
  the shared-tier inherent-method GAP-FILL (`postgres/shared_ext.rs`: the
  dependency graph, epoch-fenced node upserts, attestation policy, WP-19 HA
  lease, unchained campaign/clearance-grant row primitives, WP-15 cert
  census — with the v11 PG migration and `schema_spec::SHARED_TABLES` grown
  13→16), and the FOLD-IN of the PG backend into
  `kirra_persistence::postgres` behind a `postgres` feature. The fold-in
  supersedes stage 1's assumption that the de-cycled crate could stay
  workspace-detached: a path dependency whose own workspace root
  back-references parent-workspace members is rejected by cargo ("multiple
  workspace roots"), so the backend lives IN the persistence crate — the
  driver tree still compiles only under the feature, preserving the
  detachment's actual goals (default build, MSRV lane byte-identical).
  Remaining in stage 2: `StoreHandle` grows a
  `shared`-tier accessor dispatching to either the local `VerifierStore` or
  a `PgVerifierStore` (enum, not trait object — two variants, exhaustive
  match, no vtable on the hot path); `KIRRA_DB_URL` (registered in
  `KIRRA_ENV_KEYS`, boot-validated per EP-12) selects it. Unset →
  byte-identical SQLite path. Set-but-unreachable → **fail-closed startup
  abort**; connection loss at runtime → the affected operation errors (5xx /
  posture-recalc skip), never a silent SQLite fallback (a split brain
  between backends is worse than an outage). The rusqlite leaks in handlers
  (`is_unique_violation` matching, `rusqlite::Error` closure annotations,
  the audit-shipper cursor error type) are abstracted behind
  `kirra-persistence` as part of this stage. Root gains an optional
  `postgres` cargo feature; the workspace-detachment policy for the driver
  tree is revisited THERE (the feature stays off in the MSRV lane and the
  default build).
- **Stage 3: proof.** The two-node HA drill re-run with PG shared state
  (epoch CAS race, promotion, fencing) in the `postgres-conformance` lane;
  topology docs updated. The shared-file topology remains the DEFAULT and
  the documented small-deployment path; Postgres is the recommended
  multi-host HA topology once stage 3 lands.

## Invariants preserved

INVARIANT #12 (disk-before-memory) extends across backends: the local
chained audit write precedes the shared-state effect it records. The epoch
fence contract (`assert_actuator_epoch_held`, at-most-one-writer) is already
conformance-proven on both backends and does not change shape. `KIRRA_DB_PATH`
semantics are untouched — it names the LOCAL ledger DB in both modes.
